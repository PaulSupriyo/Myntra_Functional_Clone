# Myntra_Functional_Clone


This project is a fully functional clone of the Myntra e-commerce platform, designed to replicate the user experience and features of the original site. The clone features modern web technologies, interactive 3D dimension webpages, and an intuitive user interface for browsing and purchasing products.

Key Features -
3D Dimension Webpages: The user interface is built with modern design principles, incorporating 3D elements for a visually engaging experience.

Product Browsing: Users can browse through a wide range of products, view details, and select items to add to their shopping bag.

Add to Bag: Items can be easily added to the shopping bag. The app keeps track of the items added, including their quantities and prices.

Bag Overview: The shopping bag feature allows users to view all selected items, including product images, descriptions, and individual prices.

Total Amount Calculation: The app dynamically calculates the total cost of the items in the bag, taking into account any applicable discounts. The discount logic is built-in, ensuring that users see the best possible price for their selections.

Responsive Design: The app is fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across devices of all sizes, from mobile phones to desktops.

Technologies Used -
HTML/CSS/JavaScript: The frontend is built using HTML for structure, CSS for styling (including 3D effects), and JavaScript for interactivity and dynamic content management.
JavaScript for Logic: The app's core functionality, such as adding items to the bag, calculating totals, and applying discounts, is handled by JavaScript.
Responsive Web Design: CSS media queries and flexible layouts ensure that the app adapts to various screen sizes.


How It Works -
Adding Items: When a user browses through the catalog and selects an item, it's added to the bag using a simple JavaScript function that updates the bag's state.
View Bag: Users can view their shopping bag at any time. The bag page shows a summary of selected items, their prices, and quantities.
Total Calculation: The total cost is calculated in real-time. Discounts are applied based on predefined criteria, such as item quantity or promotions.
Checkout: While this clone focuses on the front-end experience, the checkout process can be expanded to integrate with back-end services for a complete e-commerce solution.
